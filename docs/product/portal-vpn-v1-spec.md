# POKROV VPN v1 Product Spec

Last updated: 2026-04-12

## Document Status

This file is the living client product spec for `POKROV VPN`.

## Summary

`POKROV VPN` is a `consumer-first`, `app-first` VPN application for `Android` and `Windows`.

`iOS` and `macOS` are not part of the full public `v1` promise. In this release wave they stay in readiness, packaging, and signing-preparation status only.

The target journey is:

- open the app
- tap `Try free`
- receive a real working trial subscription
- tap `Connect`

Telegram must remain optional for first use. It is a growth, recovery, and reward channel, not the primary login wall.
Bot purchase and recovery paths stay valid, but they do not replace the main app-first public journey.

## Locked Product Decisions

- product name: `POKROV VPN`
- UX direction: `consumer-first`
- account model: `app-first`
- full public `v1` scope: `Android + Windows`
- Apple scope in this wave: readiness only
- default runtime core: `sing-box`
- `xray` support: advanced compatibility fallback only
- free trial: `5 days`
- Telegram reward: `+10 days`
- recommended public routing mode: `All except RU`
- public routing mode set: `All except RU` and `Full tunnel`

## Release Gate Reality

- public `v1` scope remains `Android + Windows`
- `Windows` can continue through the normal public release path when its gates are green
- `Android` is release-blocked until a real release-build audit proves that local proxy, DNS, command, and admin/control listeners are not exposed without acceptable protection
- as of `2026-04-12`, `python scripts/release_orchestrator.py --gates-only` is green for the documented repo/static/client gate pack, but final Android publication still requires a connected-device `android_localhost_audit.py` run against a release-installed build
- when `release_gate_check.py` includes `android-apk` or `android-aab`, it must require `ANDROID_AUDIT_SERIAL` and treat emulator serials only as adb rehearsal, not as final sign-off
- `Clash API` must stay disabled by default in the shipping client; any future use remains explicit advanced opt-in only until the Android local-surface audit is fully closed
- do not tell users that split tunneling, Private Space, Knox, Shelter, or similar app isolation tools are enough to compensate for an unauthenticated local control surface unless a dedicated security review has proven that claim

## Target User Experience

### First launch

The user sees:

- brand and trust message
- `Try free` primary CTA
- short explanation that the trial activates on this device

The app should not ask for:

- keys
- subscription URLs
- Telegram login
- manual import as the primary path

### After trial activation

The app receives a real subscription payload, imports it silently, and switches to a `Quick Connect` home screen.

The home screen should show:

- a large `Connect` button
- `Auto-select` location by default
- current location or best location
- trial or subscription state
- quick access to devices, profile, and support

### Before trial activation

Before the device receives a real subscription payload:

- the onboarding card remains the primary `VPN` surface
- `Locations` stays gated and must not show fake/demo countries
- `Support` may prepare account or device context, but live ticket history appears only after a real linked session exists
- `Telegram` remains an optional reward and recovery layer, not the first-use wall
- the premium shell, onboarding card, and portal tabs ship with complete RU copy rather than a mixed RU/EN surface

### Renewal and purchase

- purchase and renewal stay available from the app
- the client continues payment through the canonical hosted checkout on `https://pay.pokrov.space/checkout/`
- checkout opens in the external browser or external application rather than through native store billing in this wave
- Telegram purchase continuation may stay visible as a secondary fallback, not the primary CTA

## Information Architecture

Primary tabs:

1. `VPN`
2. `Locations`
3. `Devices`
4. `Profile`
5. `Support`

Legacy `/config-options`, `/about`, and `/logs` may remain only as compatibility redirects. Public IA is the five-tab shell above.

Signed release builds inject updater and source-code metadata through `PORTAL_RELEASE_REPOSITORY_URL`, `PORTAL_RELEASES_API_URL`, `PORTAL_RELEASES_LATEST_URL`, `PORTAL_RELEASES_APPCAST_URL`, and `PORTAL_WARP_DEFAULTS_URL`.

Outside signed release builds, updater and source-code surfaces stay disabled instead of falling back to a personal repository URL.

## Telegram Role

Telegram is used for:

- optional account binding
- reward campaign `+10 days`
- recovery flows
- community and announcements

Current aligned channel and bot:

- channel: `@pokrov_vpn`
- main bot: `@pokrov_vpnbot`

## Support Direction

Support should be reachable from:

- the app itself
- WebApp if the user is already in the platform
- helpbot `@pokrov_supportbot`
- `support@pokrov.space`

Current client behavior for `v1`:

- app support should prepare account and device context before handing the user into Telegram or email
- the client must not pretend there is a realtime in-app support chat unless such a backend actually exists
- public recovery order stays `POKROV app -> web cabinet -> Telegram fallback`

## Branding Requirements

All public and user-visible client surfaces must ship as `POKROV VPN`.

Replace:

- app name strings
- launcher icons
- splash assets
- tray icons
- update metadata
- release asset names
- visible `Hiddify` references in UI

Tracked separately from public-v1 ship:

- internal `pubspec` name `hiddify`
- `package:hiddify/...` imports
- Android Gradle/Kotlin namespace debt that still matches the inherited source tree

Release-facing packaging must still fail if legacy `hiddify` branding leaks into signed Windows `MSIX` identity or public installer surfaces.

Brand source:

## Release Continuity

Canonical public release artifacts for this fork:

- `pokrov-vpn-android-universal.apk`
- `pokrov-vpn-android-market.aab`
- `pokrov-vpn-windows-setup-x64.exe`
- `pokrov-vpn-windows-setup-x64.msix`
- `pokrov-vpn-windows-portable-x64.zip`

Current user-facing download surfaces expose only:

- Android `Play` / `APK` / mirror URL
- Windows `EXE` / mirror URL
- install/docs fallback

Treat `AAB`, `MSIX`, and portable `ZIP` as release/store/operator artifacts unless the public payload expands.

Because Android package identity and Windows app identity changed during the
`POKROV VPN` migration, release continuity is:

- fresh install first
- migration notice required
- old app can remain installed until the new app connects successfully

The product must not promise seamless in-place update from the previous app
line.

Android packaging note:

- keep `applicationId` on the new `space.pokrov.vpn`
- keep the Gradle/Kotlin namespace on legacy `com.hiddify.hiddify` until the Android source tree is migrated as a separate task

## v1 Scope

In scope:

- app-first trial activation
- silent profile provisioning
- quick connect UX
- locations list
- devices management
- profile and renewal
- in-app support
- browser checkout continuation from the app via the canonical pay host
- Telegram reward `+10 days`
- release artifact naming and runtime link wiring for Android and Windows
- public-facing rebrand cleanup for Android and Windows
- advanced routing modes `All except RU` and `Full tunnel`
- built-in Android direct package presets for `banks`, `payments`, `marketplaces`, `telecom`, and `gov_media`
- safe diagnostics that show routing mode and route category without leaking raw config or keys
- emergency response actions such as changing location, refreshing profile, reconnecting, and contacting support

Out of scope:

- forced Telegram sign-in as the primary gate
- admin panel inside the client
- power-user-first navigation
- manual config import as the primary onboarding path
- public `Blocked only` preset until the rule layer, geo assets, and DNS behavior are actually implemented
- public iOS App Store launch
- public macOS distribution promise

## Routing And DNS Direction

Recommended RU-facing preset:

- `All except RU`

Current public preset set:

- `All except RU`
- `Full tunnel`

Planned follow-up preset:

- `Blocked only`

Expected routing behavior for `All except RU`:

- `geoip:ru` direct
- private and reserved destinations direct
- everything else proxied
- torrent and explicit local exceptions handled as dedicated rules

Release rule:

- do not present the existing `Region.ru` preference as a finished RU-routing solution until the real rule layer, geo assets, and DNS split behavior are implemented and verified

Current implementation status:

- the client now has an explicit routing-mode groundwork layer for internal `global`, `allExceptRu`, and hidden `blockedOnly`
- public copy must describe internal `global` as `Full tunnel`
- `All except RU` already maps Russian and private traffic to direct rules in the generated sing-box option set
- `Blocked only` remains hidden or internal until geo assets, DNS split policy, and leak checks are complete enough for honest public verification
- the full preset stack and DNS split policy remain follow-up work
- consumer defaults now align around `All except RU`, tunneled DoH, and first-party user-agent strings rather than legacy tool impersonation
- Android direct-routing assistance now uses a versioned built-in package catalog instead of a raw empty selector-only experience

## Apple Readiness Notes

Readiness work may include:

- bundle ID planning
- display name review
- deep-link scheme review
- entitlement and tunnel target inventory
- signing and notarization prerequisites

Those items are preparation work only until a later release wave approves public Apple distribution.
